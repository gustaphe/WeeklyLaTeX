# Weekly LaTeX Challenge #10: CV / resume!

It obviously had to come, one of the most popular things you can do with LaTeX:

Create a CV / resume

[Example](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/5c/94/66/5c9466b0b4378a3037ff9ddc3173276b.jpg)

This is what I consider a very minimalistic & pretty resume.

Use any (fun) text you like or copy the text from the example.

If you don't want to recreate the given example, you are still welcome to share your previous work related to resumes / cvs.

Post your solution as a new comment. Give direct links to the finished PDF and give a link to the .tex file. Try to not paste the source code directly into the comment, as the source code may be very long.
