# Weekly LaTeX Challenge #3: Professional letterhead!
Hey, thanks for the positive Feedback on last weeks challenge.

Thank you especially to everyone who participated by submitting their own solution.

Let's see how long we can keep this up!

Goal is to create a professional looking letterhead in LaTeX. You are more than welcome to add your own twist to it!

Try to create your document first, and only then look at the other comments. There are always more than one possibilities to do it in LaTeX, so try not to get influenced by other solutions too heavily. We would like to have as many different solutions as possible.

There will be one challenge per week, starting on monday and ending on sunday.

This weeks challenge:

Create a professional letterhead for a company!

Two examples for your inspiration:

Example 1: Minimalistic

Example 2: Modern

Use any (fake) company you like and use "Lorem Ipsum" for the body.

----

Post your solution as a new comment. Give direct links to the finished PDF and give a link to the .tex file. Try to not paste the source code directly into the comment, as the source code may be very long.

Criticism of the solutions is welcome ! We are all here to learn something new.

If you have any suggestions for next weeks challenge, PM me or leave a comment.

Have fun !
