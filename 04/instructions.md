# Weekly LaTeX Challenge #4: Charts and tables!
Hey, thanks for the positive Feedback on last weeks challenge.

Thank you especially to everyone who participated by submitting their own solution.

Let's see how long we can keep this up!

Goal is to recreate the given document in LaTeX. It doesn't have to be a 1:1 copy, but it should at least resemble the original document. You are more than welcome to add your own twist to it, e.g. modernizing it, adding new design elements, new fonts, etc.

Try to recreate the document first, and only then look at the other comments. There are always more than one possibilities to do it in LaTeX, so try not to get influenced by other solutions too heavily. We would like to have as many different solutions as possible.

There will be one challenge per week, starting on monday and ending on sunday.
