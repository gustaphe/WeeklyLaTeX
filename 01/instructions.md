# Weekly LaTeX Challenge #1: First Edition!
Hey, thanks for all the positive Feedback in my thread, in which I suggested a weekly challenge.

This will be the first weekly challenge of many.

Goal is to recreate the given document in LaTeX. It doesn't have to be a 1:1 copy, but it should at least resemble the original document. You are more than welcome to add your own twist to it, e.g. modernizing it, adding new design elements, new fonts, etc.

Try to recreate the document first, and only then look at the other comments. There are always more than one possibilities to do it in LaTeX, so try not to get influenced by other solutions too heavily. We would like to have as many different solutions as possible.

There will be one challenge per week, starting on monday and ending on sunday.

This should be pretty straightforward, challenges may become more challenging, depending on your feedback.

Post your solution as a new comment. Give direct links to the finished PDF and give a link to the .tex file. Try to not paste the source code directly into the comment, as the source code may be very long.

Criticism of the solutions is welcome ! We are all here to learn something new.

If you have any suggestions for next weeks challenge, PM me or leave a comment.

Have fun !
